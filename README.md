Problem Statement:
ChainFree has been utilizing an Excel spreadsheet to enter, store and organize data. After 4
years, the spreadsheet has become quite cumbersome and the data is not well organized.
There is no ability to pull the type of reports needed for both working with active projects and
looking at statistical data. There is no convenient way to look at a single project and all the data
associated with it. There is also no efficient way to record communications with the client.
