Problem Statement:
ChainFree has been utilizing an Excel spreadsheet to enter, store and organize data. After 4
years, the spreadsheet has become quite cumbersome and the data is not well organized.
There is no ability to pull the type of reports needed for both working with active projects and
looking at statistical data. There is no convenient way to look at a single project and all the data
associated with it. There is also no efficient way to record communications with the client.

Project Objectives:
1. Meet with ChainFree to identify tables and all pieces of data needed for the database, including how the different table will relate to each other.
2. Create a user-friendly cloud based database that includes all necessary data.
3. Create easy data entry pages.
4. Create several reports based on information from ChainFree.
5. Build a user-friendly dashboard for browsing and searching.
6. Build the database so that future affiliates can access a separate copy.
